# trackremover

This is a simple script that when called will ask you which track number to remove in a directory mkv files.

Why?

Sometimes a set of files (usually a TV Show season) will have an additional or unwanted audio, subtitle, or other track.  This script will batch remove it.  A temp file is created first so if the conversion fails, the original file will not be touched.
